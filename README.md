# How Google Search Works - RNNs and Two-Tower Architecture

## Introduction

In this project, I have developed a search engine optimization (SEO) system that mimics the core functionality of Google Search. The system leverages Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for semantic understanding of queries and documents, and a two-tower architecture for efficient ranking and retrieval.

## Key Features

1. **RNN-based Semantic Understanding**: The system uses RNNs to capture the contextual meaning and relationships within queries and documents, enabling more accurate semantic matching.

2. **Two-Tower Architecture**: The model is designed with a two-tower architecture, where one tower encodes the query, and the other tower encodes the documents. This allows for efficient ranking and retrieval by comparing the encoded representations.

3. **Streamlit Deployment**: The SEO system is deployed as a user-friendly web application using the Streamlit framework, allowing for easy interaction and demonstrations.

## Challenges Addressed

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling the complexities of real-world search data, including cleaning, tokenization, and feature engineering.

2. **Embedding Optimization**: Experimenting with both off-the-shelf and fine-tuned embeddings to achieve the best performance.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Carefully tuning the model hyperparameters, such as learning rate, batch size, and network architecture, to ensure optimal performance.

4. **Scalability**: Addressing the scalability challenges of the system to handle large-scale search data and queries.

5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Selecting and implementing appropriate evaluation metrics to assess the system's effectiveness in ranking and retrieving relevant documents.


## Future Improvements

1. **Incorporating User Feedback**: Implementing mechanisms to incorporate user feedback and preferences to further improve the ranking and retrieval results.

2. **Multimodal Integration**: Exploring the integration of other data modalities, such as images or videos, to enhance the search experience.

3. **Personalization**: Developing personalized search models that adapt to individual user preferences and search histories.

4. **Efficiency Optimization**: Investigating techniques to improve the system's efficiency, such as indexing or approximate nearest neighbor search.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to acknowledge the research and development efforts of the Google Search team, whose work has inspired and informed the development of this project.
