The most expensive patents are international patents, which can run up to $100,000 or higher. Domestically the costs can be $10,000 or above. Patent applications involve lots of text and drawings, even for simpler inventions. The first step in the patent application process is to file a non provisional patent application, which involves paying attorney fees in the range of $5000 to $15,000 or more, depending on the intricacies of the invention.
