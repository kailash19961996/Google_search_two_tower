Get the Latest health and medical information delivered direct to your inbox! The lungs are a pair of spongy, air-filled organs located on either side of the chest (thorax). The trachea (windpipe) conducts inhaled air into the lungs through its tubular branches, called bronchi. The bronchi then divide into smaller and smaller branches (bronchioles), finally becoming microscopic. Between the alveoli is a thin layer of cells called the interstitium, which contains blood vessels and cells that help support the alveoli. The lungs are covered by a thin tissue layer called the pleura. The same kind of thin tissue lines the inside of the chest cavity -- also called pleura.

Your goal is to minimize the time a food is in the danger zone — between 40 and 140 F (4 and 60 C) — when bacteria can quickly multiply. When you're ready to eat leftovers, reheat them on the stove, in the oven or in the microwave until the internal temperature reaches 165 F (74 C). After that, the risk of food poisoning increases. If you don't think you'll be able to eat leftovers within four days, freeze them immediately. Food poisoning — also called foodborne illness — is caused by harmful organisms, such as bacteria in contaminated food.

For example, in ferns, the gametophyte is a tiny heart-shaped structure, while the leafy plant we recognize as a fern is the sporophyte (see Figure above). Like all plants, nonvascular plants have an alternation of generations life cycle. In the life cycle of the nonvascular seedless plants, the gametophyte stage is the longest part of the cycle. The gametophyte is photosynthetic.
The effects of the eruption were felt worldwide. It ejected roughly 10,000,000,000 tonnes (1.1 × 10 10 short tons) or 10 km 3 (2.4 cu mi) of magma, and 20,000,000 tonnes (22,000,000 short tons) SO 2, bringing vast quantities of minerals and metals to the surface environment. It injected more particulate into the stratosphere than any eruption since Krakatoa in 1883. Over the following months, the aerosols formed a global layer of sulfuric acid haze.

What is an analog telephone line? A simple analog telephone line is a voice circuit historically made from copper wire that runs from your local phone company's Central Office (C.O.) building to your business location. The central office houses telephone switching equipment that connects you to the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN). Analog telephone lines transmit voice as electrical signals. When you speak into the handset of your phone, the microphone converts the sound waves into analog electrical waves. These waves propagate over the telephone line to their destination.

In a simple reflex arc, such as the knee jerk, a stimulus is detected by a receptor cell, which synapses with a sensory neurone. The sensory neurone carries the impulse from site of the stimulus to the central nervous system (the brain or spinal cord), where it synapses with an interneurone. The interneurone synapses with a motor neurone, which carries the nerve impulse out to an effector, such as a muscle, which responds by contracting.

They met at the house of Giovanni de' Bardi, and their gatherings had the reputation of having all the most famous men of Florence as frequent guests. After first meeting in 1573, the activity of the Camerata reached its height between 1577 and 1582. While propounding a revival of the Greek dramatic style, the Camerata's musical experiments led to the development of the stile recitativo. In this way it facilitated the composition of dramatic music and the development of opera. Unifying the Camerata members was the belief that music had become corrupt, and by returning to the forms and style of the ancient Greeks, the art of music could be improved, and thereby society could be improved as well.

Hepatitis C is usually spread through direct contact with the blood of a person who has the disease. It is caused by the virus HCV (hepatitis C Virus). The liver can swell and become damaged. In hepatitis C, unlike hepatitis B, liver cancer risk is only increased in people with cirrhosis and only 20% of hep C patients get cirrhosis. Feces is never a route of transmission in hepatitis C. Donated blood is also tested for hepatitis C. 
Aerobically respiring forms of bacteria require oxygen to live. They utilize oxygen as fuel to help burn energy and provide them with the energy needed for life. This type of bacterial respiration is the same kind that human beings use, hence the term aerobic exercise.. The major byproduct of aerobic respiration from bacteria is carbon dioxide. Other forms, such as the bacteria that causes the Bubonic Plague, can kill a person if left untreated. There are many different types of bacteria and they respire using different methods. The two primary methods of bacterial respiration are aerobic respiration and anaerobic respiration.

Known by multiple common names, such as humbug damselfish, three-striped damselfish and white-tailed damselfish, Dascyllus aruanus is a feisty little fish that adapts well to aquarium life. Three-striped damselfish can be pugnacious and are better introduced at the latter stages of setting up a marine fish community. Remove as many of the three-striped damselfish fry as you want to try and raise to a rearing aquarium, with an absence of adult fish and invertebrates that might look upon the young fish as tasty morsels for the taking. Dascyllus aruanus is a worthy first-time breeding project for up-and-coming marine aquarists.

For an equilateral triangle, the apothem is equivalent to the line segment from the midpoint of a side to any of the triangle's centers, since an equilateral triangle's centers coincide as a consequence of the definition. Because of this, all the apothems in a polygon will be congruent. For a regular pyramid, which is a pyramid whose base is a regular polygon, the apothem is the slant height of a lateral face; that is, the shortest distance from apex to base on a given face.

In addition to the cubic yard cost, some delivery companies also have minimum purchase requirements. A cubic yard of concrete commonly runs between $80 and $165, and it’s standard to order a quarter of a yard extra in case you run short. For example, if you need 2 cubic yards to pour the pad, order 2 1/4 yards. If the pad is in a spot where a concrete truck cannot back up and dump the mix, you can order a pump truck, which can add another $300, or more, to the cost. If forming and pouring your pad takes three workers two days to complete at a cost of $30 per worker hour, it could add around $1,400 to your bill. That’s not counting concrete, reinforcement, excavation and fill sand costs.

The bulk of the price of going solar is now the “soft costs” (installation, permitting, etc.) rather than the solar panel cost. Again referencing the latest US Solar Market Insight report, the average installed cost of a residential solar panel system was $4.72/watt. However, prices vary tremendously by region. “Common residential system prices ranged from less than $3.00/W to just above $7.00/W,” the Solar Energy Industries Association writes. The total price of a system, of course, varies tremendously based on the size of your roof and your electricity needs. I got a quote for my 2,000 square foot house in the Dallas area and it was $85,000 installed. Financed over 30 years that comes out to $509/month. My electric bill is about $140/month on average. So over 30 years solar would cost over $100,000 more than electricity from the grid (gas, coal, wind).

In terms of minimum salary for each team, the salary floor is 89% of the cap. That became effective in 2013, as this requirement was by-passed in 2011 and 2012. Hence, there was in essence no salary floor in 2011 or 2012. For 2011, each team may designate up to 3 of their highest paid players (who must have at least 5 accrued seasons and make at least $1 M more than the league minimum salary for that year), toward whom the team will will receive $1 M cap credit. Repayment of this credit will be applied toward the 2014-2017 league years.

Slime mold or slime mould is an informal name given to several kinds of unrelated eukaryotic organisms that can live freely as single cells, but aggregate together to form multicellular reproductive structures. Slime molds were formerly classified as fungi but are no longer considered part of that kingdom. Many slime molds, namely the cellular slime molds, actually do not spend most of their time in this state. As long as food is abundant, these slime molds exist as single-celled organisms. When food is in short supply, many of these single-celled organisms will congregate and start moving as a single body.

For the sake of simplicity let’s call the system consumer capitalism. Doing so does not ignore the fact that from the Progressivism of the early twentieth century through Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal up until the present this consumer capitalism has been modified. What label we pin on any newly emerging economic system is not as important as its ingredients. The problem with our present consumer capitalism is not the name. Critics do not desire an anti-consumer capitalism, just one that does not overemphasize consumption.

In the early years of the game, prior to 1848, baseballs were very bouncy, built with a solid rubber core and only about three inches in diameter. Hitting these lively balls, some pro teams tallied as many as 100 runs per game. You don't necessarily think of a baseball as bouncy. But that's exactly what a ball does when it collides with a bat. Like a bouncing ball, when hit with a bat a baseball deforms for an instant then springs back to its original shape.

At 10 years after receiving treatment about 50% of people are fully recovered. Globally, bulimia was estimated to affect 6.5 million people in 2013. About 1% of young women have bulimia at a given point in time and about 2% to 3% of women have the condition at some point in their lives. The condition is less common in the developing world. There is also a higher risk of suicide and self-harm. Bulimia is more common among those who have a close relative with the condition. The percentage risk that is estimated to be due to genetics is between 30% and 80%.

Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of red eye. Most frequently, conjunctivitis (and thus red eye) is caused by a bacterial or viral infection. Sexually transmitted diseases such as chlamydial infection and gonorrhea are less common causes of conjunctivitis. 
Gold is not formed on the Earth like diamonds and many other gems and minerals. Instead, most scientists now believe that gold actually came to earth from outer space in large meteorites that have struck the planet over billions of years. While diamonds can be artificially produced, there is only so much gold available on the planet. It cannot be created in a lab the way that many gemstones can be. While some scientists believe that gold mining in outer space may be the bonanza of the future, such dreams are currently too expensive to be realized.
Marijuana is the most commonly abused illegal drug in the U.S. and around the world. Those who support its legalization, for medical or for general use, fail to recognize that the greatest costs of marijuana are not related to its prohibition; they are the costs resulting from marijuana use itself. Many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: Many have suggested mixing black with white, to make gray and then mixing the gray with the yellow. Others have said using brown. My advice is get a nice clean pallet of colours and mix it about. Usually mixing red,blue and yellow to get brown. Try adding brown and white to the yellow to get a gold kind of colour. You could even try using yellowie gold and adding gold sparkles (found in many craft stores) to give it the glint of gold. Basically you need to experiment a little bit. Use small quantities first, and when you think you've got it, go for it! 
Bulimia nervosa, also known as simply bulimia, is an eating disorder characterized by binge eating followed by purging. Binge eating refers to eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time.

Illustration of Upper Respiratory System. In anatomy, a nasal concha (or turbinate) is a long, narrow and curled bone shelf (shaped like an elongated sea-shell) that protrudes into the breathing passage of the nose. Turbinate bone refers to any of the scrolled spongy bones of the nasal passages in vertebrates. In humans, the turbinates divide the nasal airway into four groove-like air passages, and are responsible for forcing inhaled air to flow in a steady, regular pattern around the largest possible surface of cilia and climate-controlling tissue.
After the war Geisel focused on his children's books, writing classics such as If I Ran the Zoo (1950), Horton Hears a Who!

The powhiri is the ritual ceremony of encounter. Traditionally the process served to discover whether the visiting party were friend or foe, and so its origins lay partly in military necessity. The kaupapa or purpose of the occasion will be discussed, and perhaps general present day issues and concerns might be aired. Each speech is followed by the performance of a waiata (song), or sometimes a haka (dance), by the orator's support group.
If the U.S. were to legalize marijuana, the number of marijuana users would increase. Today there are 15.2 million current marijuana users in comparison to 129 million alcohol users and 70.9 million tobacco users. Many people who want to legalize marijuana are passionate about their perception of the alleged failures of policies aimed at reducing marijuana use but those legalization proponents seldom—if ever—describe their own plan for taxing and regulating marijuana as a legal drug.

a voluntary muscle is a muscle that move when you tell it to Muscles in our hands (skeletal muscle) are called voluntary, because these muscles act according to the impulses (… orders) given by our conscious brain. Heart (cardiac muscle) is an example of an involuntary muscle. It works all the time with impulses from our brain stem, which is involuntary. Some more examples of voluntary muscles in our body are muscles of the chest, neck, abdomen, and legs. Involuntary muscles include the muscles of the digestive system. --- Skeletal muscles, like biceps (the muscles that flex your forearm/wrist toward your shoulder) are voluntary muscles. These muscles will not flex unless you think about flexing them, and your brain sends that signal to your arm.
Rating Newest Oldest. Best Answer: You don't always win the money amount on the front of your lectern when you are on a game show. As someone else said, 2nd place earns $2000 and 3rd place earns $1000 in Jeopardy! In any case, the prize money is paid out from the ad revenue that the show receives from sponsors. I think in this case Who Wants to be a Millionaire or Deal or No Deal is the best example of how shows can be successful while still paying the prize money. I feel this way because these shows have a potential, however small it may be, to pay out 1 million dollars to every contestant on the show. Here is the reality. Regardless of the show whether it be a game show or a drama, a network will receive money from commercial advertising based on the viewership. With this in mind a game show costs very little to actually air compared to a full production drama series, that's where the prize money comes from
Since most conifers are evergreens, the leaves of many conifers are long, thin and have a needle-like appearance, but others, including most of the Cupressaceae and some of the Podocarpaceae, have flat, triangular scale-like leaves. The conifers are an ancient group, with a fossil record extending back about 300 million years to the Paleozoic in the late Carboniferous period; even many of the modern genera are recognizable from fossils 60–120 million years old.
Monocytes are produced by the bone marrow from precursors called monoblasts, bipotent cells that differentiated from hematopoietic stem cells. Monocytes circulate in the bloodstream for about one to three days and then typically move into tissues throughout the body. Monocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to other tissues will then differentiate into tissue resident macrophages or dendritic cells. Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances, but are also suspected to be important in the formation of important organs like the heart and brain.
On average nationally, hiring an interior decorator or designer costs $7,125, with most homeowners spending between $5,544 and $8,706. If you decide to hire a professional for decorating your house, make sure you know the right kind of one that you need.
Our immune system has a key component called the white blood cells, of which there are several different kinds. Monocytes are a type of white blood cell that fights off bacteria, viruses and fungi. Monocytes are the biggest type of white blood cell in the immune system. Originally formed in the bone marrow, they are released into our blood and tissues. When certain germs enter the body, they quickly rush to the site for attack. 
Some species of bacteria go through the process of cellular respiration. This is a more complex process that doesn t need oxygen, and the energy of the organic molecules is more efficient in the creation of ATP. Carbon dioxide and water are the byproducts most usually produced. To get energy from molecules such as sugars, bacteria must use fermentation or cellular respiration. These are processes that use the energy in the molecules to make adenosine triphosphate, known as ATP.
1 Spaying and neutering for rabbits has become a safe procedure when performed by experienced rabbit veterinarians. 2  The House Rabbit Society has had over 1000 rabbits spayed or neutered with approximately .1% mortality due to anesthesia. Spay/neuter costs vary tremendously in different areas of the country. The low end of the range can be as inexpensive as $50-75 (often in spay/neuter clinics), while vets in major metropolitan areas, where rents and labor costs are very high, often charge several hundred dollars. See our veterinary listings.

There is a limit on how much you can put into super each year by salary sacrifice. Most people can contribute up to $30,000, including your employer's 9.5% super guarantee contribution. This is called the concessional contributions cap. If you earn more than $37,000, salary sacrifice can be a good way to grow your super. It involves giving up some of your pay and putting it into your super instead. You will save tax and boost your super. Salary sacrificing is when you ask your employer to redirect a portion of your pay as a contribution to super.

Today's oilskins (or oilies) typically come in two parts, jackets and trousers. Oilskin jackets are generally similar to common rubberized waterproofs. The chief difference is a high spray collar. Some have hoods, often in a high-visibility colour to increase visibility if a wearer falls overboard. The cuffs of better oilskin jackets include an inner seal at the wrist similar to that on a scuba diver's drysuit to prevent water from being forced up the sleeve. Pockets on trousers and jackets are often lined with quick-drying synthetic fleece that is warm even when soaked.

The Camerata had a hard time keeping up with the constant thirst of new and exciting attractions for the citizens of Cloudbank, so they began regulating the city. They used the Transistor to absorb influential individuals in hopes of creating constant new and interesting concepts for the city. The group uses the Transistor to integrate various individuals of influence. The true reason for integration is unknown, perhaps the Camerata had moral objection to outright killing their targets. Integration, however, does also appear to increase the functionality of the Transistor.

Each time zone is 15 degrees of longitude wide (with local variations) and the local time is one hour earlier than the zone immediately to the east on the map. The number of standard time zones is debatable and discussed among various sources, particularly with regards to the International Date Line. How Time Zones Work. Each time zone is then theoretically 15 degrees wide, corresponding to a one-hour difference in mean solar time. The shape of time zones is changed, in practice, to match internal and international borders.

Expect around $100+ for a neuter and $200+ for a spay, they need to use a different anesthesia for rabbits than with dogs and cats, make sure you use a rabbit knowledgeable vet. Rabbits can make good pets for some people, as long as you have realistic expectations. Rabbits can get pregnant at 13 weeks of age, so keep them separate until spayed & neutered. Female rabbits have a reproductive cancer rate near 85%, so an unspayed female almost always lives a very short life.
The treatment for pinkeye depends on the cause. 1  Bacteria. 2  Pinkeye caused by bacteria, including those related to STDs, is treated with antibiotics, in the form of eye drops, ointments, or pills. 3  Eye drops or ointments may need to be applied to the inside of the eyelid three to four times a day for five to seven days. The symptoms of pinkeye differ based on the cause of the inflammation, but may include: 1  Redness in the white of the eye or inner eyelid. 2  Increased amount of tears. 3  Thick yellow discharge that crusts over the eyelashes, especially after sleep. 4  Green or white discharge from the eye.
In order to build the time zone map, they studied Earth’s movements. As the Earth rotates on its axis, it moves about 15 degrees every 60 minutes. After 24 hours, it has completed a full circle rotation of 360 degrees. The scientists used this information to divide the planet into 24 sections or time zones. Each time zone is 15 degrees of longitude wide. If we had one single time zone for Earth, noon would be the middle of the day in some places, but it would be morning, evening and the middle of the night in others. Since different parts of the Earth enter and exit daylight at different times, we need different time zones
Cirrhosis is most commonly caused by alcohol, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Typically, more than two or three drinks per day over a number of years is required for cirrhosis to occur. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is due to a number of reasons, including being overweight, diabetes, high blood fats, and high blood pressure. A number of less common causes include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, hemochromatosis, certain medications, and gallstones.
You may have gallbladder surgery as an outpatient, or you may stay 1 or 2 days in the hospital. Most people can return to their normal activities in 7 to 10 days. People who have laparoscopic gallbladder surgery are sore for about a week. But in 2 to 3 weeks they have much less discomfort than people who have open surgery. No special diets or other precautions are needed after surgery. What To Think About. Recovery is much faster and less painful after laparoscopic surgery than after open surgery. 1  The hospital stay after laparoscopic surgery is shorter than after open surgery. 2  People generally go home the same day or the next day, compared with 2 to 4 days or longer for open surgery.

Fluid power is a term describing hydraulics and pneumatics technologies. Both technologies use a fluid (liquid or gas) to transmit power from one location to another. With hydraulics, the fluid is a liquid (usually oil), whereas pneumatics uses a gas (usually compressed air). The principles of pneumatics are the same as those for hydraulics, but pneumatics transmits power using a gas instead of a liquid.

The dry wood is a store of chemical energy. As it burns in the fireplace, chemical energy is released and converted to thermal energy (heat) and light energy. Notice that the wood now turns into ashes (a new substance). Food is also a good example of stored chemical energy. This energy is released during digestion. Molecules in our food are broken down into smaller pieces. As the bonds between these atoms loosen or break, a chemical reaction will occur, and new compounds are created
2 Working with the eggs one at a time, crack the egg into a small bowl or cup. Place the bowl close to the surface of the hot water and gently slip the egg into the water. If you want, use a spoon to push some of the egg whites closer to their yolks, to help them hold together.

The costs can add up quickly no doubt, and there will be post-filing costs once the Patent Examiner starts to examine the application filed, but those will be the subject of a future article. Still, you should budget at least another $5,000 to $7,500 for prosecution and issue fees to the Patent Office. By way of example, you could probably find an attorney to write a patent for a business method or computer software for quite cheap, but a cheap computer related patent would not be nearly as strong as a patent application costing $20,000 or more. The devil is always in the details.

In many cases, the chemical process of respiration requires oxygen, although some organisms are able to carry out respiration in the absence of oxygen. This page will explain the three types of respiration found in microorganisms, as well as how these types of respiration affect the wastewater treatment plant. Aerobic Respiration. Aerobic respiration is respiration in the presence of oxygen. Most multicellular organisms and many microorganisms produce their energy using aerobic respiration. In aerobic respiration, sugars are broken down in the presence of oxygen to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Without oxygen, aerobic microorganisms are unable to produce energy and quickly die

It produces haploid spores that develop into a gametophyte.
Like many other early information technologies, EDI was inspired by developments in military logistics. The complexity of the 1948 Berlin airlift required the development of concepts and methods to exchange, sometimes over a 300 baud teletype modem, vast quantities of data and information about transported goods. In EDI terminology inbound and outbound refer to the direction of transmission of an EDI document in relation to a particular system, not the direction of merchandise, money or other things represented by the document.

Coating the surface of the cerebrum and the cerebellum is a vital layer of tissue the thickness of a stack of two or three dimes. It is called the cortex, from the Latin word for bark. Most of the actual information processing in the brain takes place in the cerebral cortex. When people talk about gray matter in the brain they are talking about this thin rind. The cortex is gray because nerves in this area lack the insulation that makes most other parts of the brain appear to be white. The folds in the brain add to its surface area and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the quantity of information that can be processed.

However, cardiac muscle shares features of both smooth and skeletal muscle tissue. It is striated like skeletal muscle tissue, but its contractions are involuntary, like those of smooth muscle tissue. Cardiac muscle is unique in that is particularly invulnerable to fatigue. A beating heart is one of the best examples of an involuntary muscle. Contractions of cardiac muscles push blood through the four chambers of the human heart. The process of peristalsis, which pushes food through the esophagus and small intestine, is controlled by involuntary muscles.

3D Rendering of a Monocyte. Monocytes are a type of white blood cells (leukocytes). They are the largest of all leukocytes. They are part of the innate immune system of vertebrates including all mammals (humans included), birds, reptiles, and fish. Monocytes which migrate from the bloodstream to other tissues will then differentiate into tissue resident macrophages or dendritic cells. Macrophages are responsible for protecting tissues from foreign substances, but are also suspected to be important in the formation of important organs like the heart and brain.
This is taken directly from-http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-monocytes.htm#. Monocytes are a type of leukocyte or white blood cell which play a role in immune system function. Depending on a patient's level of health, monocytes make up between one and three percent of the total white blood cells in the body. For example, if monocytes are elevated because of an inflammation caused by a viral infection, the patient would be given medication to kill the virus and bring down the inflammation. Typically, when a monocyte count is requested, the lab will also run other tests on the blood to generate a complete picture.

Definition. Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP for short, is the energy currency of life. ATP is a high-energy molecule found in every cell. Its job is to store and supply the cell with needed energy. ATP is found in the cytoplasm of the cell. The cytoplasm is the gel-type filler of the cell where all of the organelles of the cell hang out. This location makes sense because the ATP needs to be near all of the cell parts so that it can supply them with the energy they need for chemical and mechanical reactions.

Heat can only be transferred through three means: conduction, convection and radiation. Of these, conduction is perhaps the most common, and occurs regularly in nature. In short, it is the transfer of heat through physical contact. It occurs when you press your hand onto a window pane, when you place a pot of water on an active element, and when you place an iron in the fire.
In nonvascular plants, like mosses, the sporophyte generation is not the dominant generation. This means that the sporophyte is smaller is size and shorter lived than the gametophyte generation.

Chemical potential energy depends on the strength of the bonds; strong bonds have low energy and weak ones have high energy. Large amounts of heat and/or light energy are released during the formation of strong bonds. Conversely, more energy is required to break strong bonds than weaker bonds. An example of this principle is in a combustion reaction within a car's engine. The gasoline reacts with oxygen when ignited by a spark in the engine. Chemical potential energy that once was stored is then released and the car is set in motion.

Palladium is one of the three most popular metals used to make white gold alloys (nickel and silver can also be used). Palladium-gold is a more expensive alloy than nickel-gold, but seldom causes allergic reactions (though certain cross-allergies with nickel may occur). Palladium is a soft silver-white metal that resembles platinum. It is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and greatly increases its strength and hardness when it is cold-worked.

Brodmann Areas. Over a lifetime, the various parts of the brain that control the body's movements can suffer damage from various causes, such as head injuries, strokes, and degenerative brain diseases. One typical example is what happens when one side of the motor cortex is completely destroyed by a stroke. The basic function of the brain is to produce behaviours, which are, first and foremost, movements. Several different regions of the cerebral cortex are involved in controlling the body's movements. These regions are organized into a hierarchy like the crew of a ship.

It was in the year 1976 when this company introduced the “slime” toy which was originally put in a trash can. Its content was a sticky, viscous green substance which is made from guar gum. Mattel’s original version of slime was green, making this color synonymous with the term “slime”. Green slime is also even made more famous because it is frequently used in a TV channel called “Nickelodeon”. This is a type of board game that involves a plastic monster that has a slimy mouth. The object of the game is to avoid being “slimed” by this plastic monster. Other toymakers also joined the slime craze and made their own versions of this popular sticky toy.
The initiation of cell transformation is generally associated with genetic alterations in normal cells that lead to the loss of intercellular-and/or extracellular-matrix- (ECM-) mediated cell adhesion. Cancer afflicts an organ or a tissue by inducing abnormal and uncontrolled division of cells that either constitute it or migrate to it. At the cellular level, this is caused by genetic alterations in networks that regulate cell division and cell death.
Save. Jay Paul/Getty Images News/Getty Images. A master's degree takes anywhere from one to three years to complete, depending on the type of degree and the amount of time you can devote to your studies. It's a sizable investment of time and money, but in many professional fields, it's the degree that can open doors. Some universities and programs offer undergraduates what's often called a 4+1, the option of beginning work toward a master's while finishing up a four-year degree, which can take a year off the time required to get the advanced degree. Such programs begin in the second or third year of undergraduate studies.
Pneumatics (Greek:which means breath) is a branch of physics applied to technology that makes use of gas or pressurized air. Pneumatic systems used extensively in industry are commonly powered by compressed air or compressed inert gases. A centrally located and electrically powered compressor powers cylinders, air motors, and other pneumatic devices. A pneumatic system controlled through manual or automatic solenoid valves is selected when it provides a lower cost, more flexible, or safer alternative to electric motors and actuators. Pneumatics also has applications in dentistry, construction, mining, and other areas.

By invoking the name Prencipe Galeotto in the alternative title to Decameron, Boccaccio alludes to a sentiment he expresses in the text: his compassion for women deprived of free speech and social liberty, confined to their homes and, at times, lovesick. Boccaccio probably conceived the Decameron after the epidemic of 1348, and completed it by 1353. The various tales of love in The Decameron range from the erotic to the tragic. Tales of wit, practical jokes, and life lessons contribute to the mosaic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence (for example on Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales), it provides a document of life at the time
An assault is carried out by a threat of bodily harm coupled with an apparent, present ability to cause the harm.

A series of blood screenings are performed to test for HIV. The enzyme-linked immuno assay (ELISA or EIA) is the first test that your doctor will order to screen for HIV. ELISA and the Western blot test detect HIV antibodies in your blood. Antibodies are proteins your immune system produces in response to the presence of foreign substances such as viruses. If you test positive for HIV with the Western blot test, you probably have HIV. Sometimes, HIV does not show up on the ELISA test even though you are infected. This can happen if someone is in the early stages of the infection, and his or her body has not produced enough antibodies to the virus for the tests to detect.

Also called hawk moths, sphinx moths, clearwing moths and bee-hawk moths, and in the caterpillar stage, they are called hornworms. Hummingbird moths share a lot of common characteristics with hummingbirds, which often leads to confusion if backyard birders aren't aware that these distinct moths may be nearby. 1 Flocks: Hummingbirds are more aggressive than moths, and while some flocks may form at feeding areas, it is more common to see hummingbirds alone. 2  Hummingbird moths, however, are more likely to travel together and show no aggression toward other moths.

The Pharynx is made up of three parts: It extends from the Larynx itself up to the Oropharynx behind the mouth. The Laryngopharynx is actually behind the Larynx and is defined by the form of the Epiglottis. It is directly above the Esophagus and serves as the junction of the Pharynx and
Concept 1 Review. The ATP molecule can store energy in the form of a high energy phosphate bond joining the terminal phosphate group to the rest of the molecule. In this form, energy can be stored at one location, then moved from one part of the cell to another, where it can be released to drive other biochemical reactions. The energy stored in ATP at one location is released from ATP when the terminal phosphate bond is broken. In this process a phosphate group is detached to yield inorganic phosphate and ADP and results in the liberation of 7.3 kcal/mol (under standard conditions)

Care considerations: The three-striped damselfish can be kept by itself in setups of as little as 10 gallons, but a minimum aquarium size of 30 gallons is recommended. The three-striped damselfish needs to have plenty of crevices in the rockwork in which to occasionally hide and feel secure. Remove as many of the three-striped damselfish fry as you want to try and raise to a rearing aquarium, with an absence of adult fish and invertebrates that might look upon the young fish as tasty morsels for the taking. Dascyllus aruanus is a worthy first-time breeding project for up-and-coming marine aquarists.

The difference between upper and lower quartiles (Q 3 –Q 1), which is called the interquartile range, also indicates the dispersion of a data set. The interquartile range spans 50% of a data set, and eliminates the influence of outliers because, in effect, the highest and lowest quarters are removed. Semi-quartile range. The semi-quartile range is another measure of spread. It is calculated as one half the difference between the 75th percentile (often called Q 3) and the 25th percentile (Q 1). The formula for semi-quartile range is: (Q 3 –Q 1) ÷ 2.

However, the full educational course leading to a doctorate in nursing can take eight years or more. Licensed practical nurses (LPNs), sometimes known as licensed vocational nurses (LVNs), assist registered nurses and provide basic patient care. Nursing school programs for LPNs are typically one year long and involve classroom work as well as supervised clinical experience.
Since vitamin A is fat-soluble it is not needed in daily, large quantities. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body in organs such as the liver. Most of the vitamin A that we consume goes to the liver to be stored until it is needed by another part of the body. The vitamin A that we obtain from animal products is called retinoids and can be used by our bodies without any modification. The form of vitamin A found in fruits and vegetables is known as carotenoids. The most common type of carotenoid is-carotene (beta carotene).

Gas exchange is the delivery of oxygen from the lungs to the bloodstream, and the elimination of carbon dioxide from the bloodstream to the lungs. It occurs in the lungs between the alveoli and a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries, which are located in the walls of the alveoli. The walls of the alveoli actually share a membrane with the capillaries in which oxygen and carbon dioxide move freely between the respiratory system and the bloodstream.
James Madison was called the father of the constitution because he was the author of the basic plan of government that the Convention adopted. Not only that, but he kept careful notes at Convention which was not open to the public.
Report Abuse. I would suggest that the adult owner of the pool has the right to set a minimum age for swimming in their pool, alone or otherwise. A general rule for all swimming (and other water sports) is 'never swim alone'. Most pools say you have to be over 14 to swim without adult supervision. If your under 14 and over 8 they make your parent sign a waver but under that you can't be by yourself. Source(s): I work at a pool.
The city I live in does it this way, and students are paid $600 a week while in school. Other than that you can attend a police academy at a local community college.

RBA uses a data-driven, decision-making process to help communities and organizations get beyond talking about problems to taking action to solve problems. It is a simple, common sense framework that everyone can understand. RBA starts with ends and works backward, towards means. The “end” or difference you are trying to make looks slightly different if you are working on a broad community level or are focusing on your specific program or organization. RBA improves the lives of children, families, and communities and the performance of programs because RBA: 1  Gets from talk to action quickly; 2  Is a simple, common sense process that everyone can understand; 3  Helps groups to surface and challenge assumptions that can be barriers to innovation;

Recovering from a gallbladder removal. Recovery after keyhole surgery to remove your gallbladder (laparoscopic cholecystectomy) is usually quick. Most people are able to eat and drink and leave hospital on the same day as the surgery. In some cases you may be advised to stay overnight and go home the next day. After open surgery, you will have to stay three to five days in hospital and your recovery time will be longer. Typically, it takes around four to six weeks to recover fully from the effects of open surgery. 
Ronald Wilson Reagan (/ˈrɒnəld ˈwɪlsən ˈreɪɡən/ ; February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American politician, commentator, and actor, who served as the 40th President of the United States from 1981 to 1989. I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it.
Multiple clinical trials have compared buprenorphine with methadone for opioid maintenance. Most studies have shown that buprenorphine (less than 40 mg) is as effective as low-dose methadone (less than 40 mg). 17, 18 High-dose methadone (greater than 60 mg) may be more effective than buprenorphine, however. A meta-analysis 18 of five studies that compared the two therapies showed that 8 to 12 mg of buprenorphine is not as effective as 50 to 80 mg of methadone. 19 A 2004 Cochrane review 16 confirmed these findings.

The cerebral cortex is the cerebrum 's (brain) outer layer of neural tissue in humans and other mammals. It is divided into two cortices, along the sagittal plane: the left and right cerebral hemispheres divided by the medial longitudinal fissure. The cerebral cortex plays a key role in memory, attention, perception, awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. The human cerebral cortex is 2 to 4 millimetres (0.079 to 0.157 in) thick. In large mammals, the cerebral cortex is folded, giving a much greater surface area in the confined volume of the skull.
Arterioles are the smallest arteries and regulate blood flow into capillary beds through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Capillaries are the smallest vessels and allow for exchange of substances between the blood and interstitial fluid. Continuous capillaries are most common and allow passage of fluids and small solutes. Fenestrated capillaries are more permeable to fluids and solutes than continuous capillaries.
Two criminal laws specifically deal with unattended kids. One says that leaving a child 6 years of age or younger unattended in a motor vehicle for more than 10 minutes is child endangerment. Unattended means not accompanied by someone at least 14 years old, or out of that person's sight. This offense is a Class A misdemeanor (possible 1 year in jail and $1,000 fine). I say that a good age would be 10 or 11. As a parent of an eleven year old I am letting her swim ALONE.
Puberty is started by hormones, which are chemicals that tell parts of the body to do things. Today, on average, girls start puberty at age 10 or 11, and boys at age 11 or 12. However, people all over the world start puberty at different ages. For most boys, puberty takes about six years and ends when they are about 17 or 18 years old. At the end of puberty, a teenager is usually about 10 to 30 centimetres (cm) (4 to 12 inches (in)) taller, 7 to 29 kilograms (kg) (15 to 65 pounds (lb)) heavier, and stronger.

Not always 1 hour's difference. Some countries have non-standard time zones, usually with a 30-minute offset (a few have a 45-minute offset). For example, the time zone in India is five hours and 30 minutes (UTC+5:30) ahead of UTC. Time zones’ boundaries are irregular mainly because of political factors, and so this has been a subject of criticism. How Time Zones Work. Each time zone is then theoretically 15 degrees wide, corresponding to a one-hour difference in mean solar time. The shape of time zones is changed, in practice, to match internal and international borders.

Gold is a chemical element with symbol Au (from Latin: aurum) and atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements, and is solid under standard conditions. The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from −1 to +5, but Au(I) and Au(III) dominate its chemistry. Au(I), referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers, thiolates, and tertiary phosphines. Au(I) compounds are typically linear.
Win the prize, pay the tax piper. Most of us know if we win a cash prize, there are taxes to pay. Big prizes mean big taxes.

In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to retinol (chemically an alcohol) in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods 1  : Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. 2  Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester
If you are cooking at high temps, carryover can be up to 10°F. If you are cooking at low temps, it might not go up the full 5°F. But 5°F is a good rule of thumb for most roasts. Medium rare is the best temp for beef, lamb, venison steaks, roasts, and duck breasts. Food scientists have equipment to measure tenderness and juiciness. But at that temp, it takes at least two hours to kill them to 7D. The time gets lower as the temperature goes higher. So beef at 140°F degrees will get to a 7D kill rate in just 12 minutes, while at 160°F degrees, pathogens are destroyed in just 7.3 seconds, hence the USDA guidelines for the consumer.
Peanut butter in small amounts can stimulate your body to produce the HDL cholesterol that clean LDL out of your bloodstream and reduce your cholesterol. However, the saturated fats in peanut butter mean your body will simultaneously produce harmful LDL as well.

Carp are various species of oily freshwater fish of the family Cyprinidae, a very large group of fish native to Europe and Asia. Carp have long been an important food fish to humans. Several species such as the various goldfish breeds and the domesticated common carp variety known as koi have been popular ornamental fishes. As a result, carp have been introduced to various locations, though with mixed results.
Possums have long prehensile tails, which are naked on the underside which gives the possum more grip when it is in the trees. Possums also have sharp claws which enable them to climb up tree trunks more easily. Possums are omnivorous animals so possums naturally eat a variety of both plants and other animals. The pygmy possum is the smallest species of possum in the world, growing to just 10cm tall, where the brushtail possum can reach more than a meter in height.

There are four major groups of the igneous rocks: basalt, andesite, dacite and rhyolite. Each of these different rock groups form different types of volcanoes. Volcanic rocks forming during eruption of Kilauea, USGS. Rhyolite rocks. Rhyolite magma cooling underground forms granite. Granite has large interlocking crystals that can be easily seen if you hold the rock at arm's length. Rhyolite is associated super volcanoes and explosive volcanic eruptions that create calderas. Basalt rocks. Basalt rocks are formed from dark heavy lava that usually forms in the upper mantle. Pillow basalt covers all the ocean floors. It forms when lava erupts on the ocean floor at spreading ridges where two crustal plates are separating.
Analog is also rather limited in terms of mobile phone technology. With a cordless device (such as a mobile or home phone), analog is limited in the range that it is able to pick up (of course, that more or less depends on the environment in which one uses the phone). Digital phones allow more users to use their mobile phones within a single area of coverage. Analog phones use technology that translates audio or video signals into electronic pulses; digital phones use technology that translates audio or video signals into binary code. 2. Analog phones have a substantially higher sound quality; digital phones have a slightly clearer sound.
The poacher is actually coddling the eggs, not truly poaching them, but if what you want is an egg with a cooked white and runny yolk, this is an easy way to do it. To use an egg poaching pan, remove the cups from the pan that you intend to use. Fill the pan with only 1/2-inch of water and bring it to a low boil. One way to help your poached egg whites stay together is to remove some of the thin wispy egg whites before you add your eggs to the hot water. An easy way to do this is with a fine mesh sieve. 1 Place the raw egg into a fine mesh sieve over a bowl. The very thin egg whites will drain out through the sieve
consumer girl image by Lev Dolgatshjov from Fotolia.com. Consumer capitalism is a term that has been continually redefined since its introduction into popular culture in the 1920s as the public relations industry became ubiquitous, and used techniques derived from psychology and sociology to mass market consumer goods. For instance, the consumer may think he wants or needs a product, and as long as this desire is maintained, the value of the product will continue to rise. Consumer capitalism functions on the basic economic paradigm of supply and demand, but without regard to a product's intrinsic value.

This is because they flowed down pre-existing river or V-shaped valleys during the last glaciation and caused the bottom of the V to level out into a U shape as the ice eroded the valley walls, resulting in a wider, deeper valley. For this reason, U-shaped valleys are sometimes referred to as glacial troughs. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo).

Young sporophytes of the common moss Tortula muralis. In mosses, the gametophyte is the dominant generation, while the sporophytes consist of sporangium-bearing stalks growing from the tips of the gametophytes. A sporophyte (/spɔːroʊˌfaɪt/) is the diploid multicellular stage in the life cycle of a plant or alga. In flowering plants the gametophytes are very reduced in size, and are represented by the pollen and the embryo sac. The sporophyte produces spores (hence the name) by meiosis, a process also known as reduction division that reduces the number of chromosomes in each spore mother cell by half.

Established by Grant Kendrell and Royce Bracket, the group circumvents the official administration and democratic nature of Cloudbank, in order to establish some form of stability in the ever-changing city. The group uses the Transistor to integrate various individuals of influence. The true reason for integration is unknown, perhaps the Camerata had moral objection to outright killing their targets. Integration, however, does also appear to increase the functionality of the Transistor.

Valleys are one of the most common landforms on the Earth and they are formed through erosion or the gradual wearing down of the land by wind and water. In river valleys for example, the river acts as an erosional agent by grinding down the rock or soil and creating a valley. One of the world's most famous U-shaped valleys is Yosemite Valley in California. It has a broad plain that now consists of the Merced River along with granite walls that were eroded by glaciers during the last glaciation (photo).

Pneumatics is the technology of compressed air, but in some circles, it is more fashionable to refer to it as a type of automation control. Pressurized gas—generally air that may be either of the dry or lubricated type—is used to actuate an end effector and do work. A pneumatic system generally uses an air compressor to reduce the volume of the air, thereby increasing the pressure of the gas. The pressurized gas travels through pneumatic hoses and is controlled by valves on the way to the actuator.

A bartender’s income is comprised mostly of tips– 55% to be exact. In some states, employers aren’t even required to pay their bartenders the minimum wage and can pay as low as $2.13 per hour, and they depend on their tips almost entirely. Bartending can be a lot of things. For some it is exciting, for others exhausting. At times there is a lot of fun to be had, at others it is rather dull. But for the most part, bartending is almost always rewarding in the financial sense, as long as you stick with it.

1 This trait is a derived character-state (in relation to poikilothermy, the character-state inferred to have been that of the last common ancestor of both groups), which therefore is hypothesized to have evolved independently in these two groups (or at least in the larger clades to which these groups belong). Simplicity is often secondarily derived. For example, the absence of mitochondria in the anaerobic protist Entamoeba histolytica is a result of their secondary loss, and when considered in the context of eukaryotes as a whole, is a derived trait.
In patients who have kidney disease or diabetes, urine tests are used to monitor the condition. Urinalysis also may be performed to detect a urinary tract infection (UTI) , protein in the urine (proteinuria), or blood in the urine (hematuria), and to diagnose pregnancy.

In flowering plants, the sporophyte comprises the whole multicellular body except the pollen and embryo sac. Bryophytes (mosses, liverworts and hornworts) have a dominant gametophyte phase on which the adult sporophyte is dependent for nutrition. The embryo sporophyte develops by cell division of the zygote within the female sex organ or archegonium, and in its early development is therefore nurtured by the gametophyte. In flowering plants the gametophytes are very reduced in size, and are represented by the pollen and the embryo sac. The sporophyte produces spores (hence the name) by meiosis, a process also known as reduction division that reduces the number of chromosomes in each spore mother cell by half.
Whether or not a trait is considered derived depends on the group in question. For example, among the (crown group) tetrapods, having five fingers is the primitive trait-as their last common ancestor bore a five-digit hand. Simplicity is often secondarily derived. For example, the absence of mitochondria in the anaerobic protist Entamoeba histolytica is a result of their secondary loss, and when considered in the context of eukaryotes as a whole, is a derived trait.

Tumor suppressor genes are genes that inhibit cell division, survival, or other properties of cancer cells. Tumor suppressor genes are often disabled by cancer-promoting genetic changes. Typically, changes in many genes are required to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell. Cells often die if they are damaged, through failure of a vital process or the immune system; however, sometimes damage will knock out a single cancer gene. In an old person, there are thousands, tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of knocked-out cells.

The elemental composition of the human body can be looked at from the point of view of either mass composition, or atomic composition. To illustrate both views, the adult male human body is approximately 57% water, and water is 11% hydrogen by mass but 67% by count of atoms (i.e. 67 atomic percent). Thus, most of the mass of the human body is oxygen, but most of the atoms in the human body are hydrogen atoms. The average 70 kg adult human body contains approximately 7 x 10 27 atoms and contains at least detectable traces of 60 chemical elements. About 29 of these elements are thought to play an active positive role in life and health in humans.

A Closer Look: Energy and ATP. The ATP molecule can store energy in the form of a high energy phosphate bond joining the terminal phosphate group to the rest of the molecule. In this form, energy can be stored at one location, then moved from one part of the cell to another, where it can be released to drive other biochemical reactions. The energy stored in ATP at one location is released from ATP when the terminal phosphate bond is broken. In this process a phosphate group is detached to yield inorganic phosphate and ADP and results in the liberation of 7.3 kcal/mol (under standard conditions)

The biggest advantage of using fossil fuels is that they can be easily stored and transported from one place to another. Large reserves of coal are therefore taken from the coal mines to the industries which are acres away from the mines. The petroleum is also taken to too far off power stations to produce energy. Fossil fuels are the highest producers of calorific value in terms of energy. This is also one of the reasons why they are still preferred over the renewable sources of energy or the alternative source

Consumer Capitalism will be a critical addition to the growing debate on the consumer as citizen and consumer protection policies. The unfettered marketplace, in which uncertainty rules and the admonition caveat emptor ('let the buyer beware') dictates each consumer decision, has today virtually disappeared. Consumers have become the focus of intensive economic policymaking designed to protect them from the risks and disappointments of the market.
It depends upon a new kind of individualism-projective individualism, where persons use consumer capitalism to project the kind of person who they want to be.

Consumer capitalism is a theoretical economic and social political condition in which consumer demand is manipulated, in a deliberate and coordinated way, on a very large scale, through mass-marketing techniques, to the advantage of sellers. The theory is controversial. It suggests manipulation of consumer demand so potent that it has a coercive effect, amounts to a departure from free-market capitalism, and has an adverse effect on society in general. According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straight forward. Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.
Muscle tissue is a soft tissue that composes muscles in animal bodies, and gives rise to muscles' ability to contract. This is opposed to other components or tissues in muscle such as tendons or perimysium. It is formed during embryonic development through a process known as myogenesis. Muscle tissue varies with function and location in the body. In mammals the three types are: skeletal or striated muscle; smooth or non-striated muscle; and cardiac muscle, which is sometimes known as semi-striated

There are two basic methods for your computer to send or receive EDI transactions with your partner’s computer: direct communication, and Value Added Network (VAN).
Analog vs. Digital Phones. An analog phone is one which makes use of analog technology. Analog technology is simply the process by which the technology takes an audio or video signal and translates it into electronic pulses (the human voice being transmitted over the phone, for instance). Analog phones use technology that translates audio or video signals into electronic pulses; digital phones use technology that translates audio or video signals into binary code. 2. Analog phones have a substantially higher sound quality; digital phones have a slightly clearer sound.
If you think that a master’s degree is the right choice for you there are numerous options to consider. How long it will take you to complete a master’s degree depends primarily upon which program you want to pursue and whether you want to attend class on a full-or part-time basis.

A valley formed by flowing water, or river valley, is usually V-shaped. The exact shape will depend on the characteristics of the stream flowing through it. Rivers with steep gradients, as in mountain ranges, produce steep walls and a bottom. Shallower slopes may produce broader and gentler valleys. A valley carved by glaciers is normally U-shaped. The valley becomes visible upon the recession of the glacier that forms it. When the ice recedes or thaws, the valley remains, often littered with small boulders that were transported within the ice.

Compounds have many functions that encourage a human cell and a human body to function. Compounds are pure substances made up of atoms of two or more elements chemically combined together in fixed ratios determined by mass. Chemically, carbohydrates are organic molecules made up of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and are produced by green plants in the process of undergoing photosynthesis. A carbohydrate can be broken down into four different chemical groups: monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides.

The time has most definitely come, and here's why: As I mentioned above, I think it justifiable to pay the $120 for a year of Lumosity (as long as you actually use it). It's a lot of money to pay in one shot, but if you buy two new video games in a year it'll cost about the same. But, in my opinion, Lumosity is really only good for one year. After that, it loses its worth (and that worth is definitely already subjective; see below). And, if you don't really have the money, then don't do it. There are a lot of other things that you could spend $120 on.

Gametes (sperm and ova) are haploid cells. The haploid gametes produced by most organisms combine to form a zygote with n pairs of chromosomes, i.e. 2 n chromosomes in total. The chromosomes in each pair, one of which comes from the sperm and one from the egg, are said to be homologous. Cells and organisms with pairs of homologous chromosomes are called diploid. For example, most animals are diploid and produce haploid gametes. During meiosis, sex cell precursors have their number of chromosomes halved by randomly choosing one member of each pair of chromosomes, resulting in

If you're up for exploring the area by bike (one of the best ways to do so as much of it is parkland), take the train to Concord West station on the Northern Line (red line on the Sydney Trains map-about 20-25 minutes from the city on a direct train).
Molasses is thick and has a high viscosity. Non-Newtonian fluids, like slime, have a different viscosity based on the amount of force put on them. If a small amount of force is applied, such as stirring them slowly with your fingers, they feel thin and water-like. If a high force is applied, like throwing it against a wall, the resistance is very strong. It often has an unpleasant odor, a green color, and is cold and slimy to the touch. In scientific terms, slime is classified as a non-Newtonian fluid. These are thick liquids that have a variable viscosity. Viscosity is a measurement of the resistance to flow when a shearing force is applied.
Heat is transferred in several different ways, either conduction, convection, and radiation. Regardless of the method of transfer, only heat can be transferred. Cold is simply the absence of heat and cannot be transferred by any method. Conduction is the transfer of heat from one molecule to another through a substance. Not all substances conduct heat at the same speed. Metals are considered good conductors since they can speedily transfer heat. Stone is also a moderately good conductor, but wood, paper, air, and cloth are poor heat conductors

Acidosis is a serious metabolic imbalance in which there is an excess of acidic molecules in the body. This can occur as a result of acid overproduction, impaired acid transport, acid underexcretion, or any combination. With overproduction, the body makes too much acid. This can occur in sepsis, a life-threatening widespread infection in which the body makes too much lactic acid. With underexcretion, the body is unable to rid itself of excess acid. This can occur in renal failure and various lung diseases. In renal failure, the kidneys are unable to cleanse the blood of acid.

Metabolic acidosis is a primary decrease in serum HCO 3. Rarely, metabolic acidosis can be part of a mixed or complex acid-base disturbance in which 2 or more separate metabolic or respiratory derangements occur together. In these instances, pH may not be reduced or the HCO 3 - concentration may not be low.

The collagen provides flexibility while the minerals provide tensile strength. The skeletal system has five main functions in the body, three of which are external and visible to the naked eye, and two of which are internal. The external functions are: structure, movement and protection. The internal functions are: blood cell production and storage. Save. The skeletal system is divided into two parts, the axial skeleton and appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton includes the skull, spinal column, ribs and sternum. The appendicular skeleton includes all upper and lower extremities, the shoulder girdle and the pelvic girdle.

Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, normally from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities. However, not all organisms that use light as a source of energy carry out photosynthesis, since photoheterotrophs use organic compounds, rather than carbon dioxide, as a source of carbon. In plants, algae and cyanobacteria, photosynthesis releases oxygen.
Directions. 1  Put some olive oil in the bottom of a 9X13 pan (just enough to put the drumsticks on). 2  Add drumsticks (space enough apart so they aren't touching each other). 3  Sprinkle generously with pepper and garlic powder. 4  Bake at 375 for half an hour. 5  Bake another half an hour (or until cooked til 160 degrees)).
In the diploid stage, sperm and eggs, produced by the gametophyte, are able to join as sperm moves through water, using a special tail-like structure. Diploid means that the chromosomes are paired-one from the egg, one from the sperm. The sperm move through the water down into the part of the plant that holds the egg. Summary. To find a bryophyte, such as mosses, liverworts, or hornworts, look for short, spongy plants growing along the rocks, soil, and trees in a damp fresh water environment. If you touched one, it would feel spongy and wet.
Her crest peaks at 288 feet (88 meters) above the east front plaza of the U.S. Capitol. She is a female allegorical figure whose right hand holds the hilt of a sheathed sword while a laurel wreath of victory and the Shield of the United States are clasped in her left hand. Crawford was commissioned to design Freedom in 1854 and executed the plaster model for the statue in his studio in Rome. Mississippian senator and U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis (who would later become President of the Confederacy) was in charge of the Capitol construction and its decorations.
Glucose is a carbohydrate, and is the most important simple sugar in human metabolism. Glucose is called a simple sugar or a monosaccharide because it is one of the smallest units which has the characteristics of this class of carbohydrates. Glucose is also sometimes called dextrose. Corn syrup is primarily glucose.
The gene mutations you're born with and those that you acquire throughout your life work together to cause cancer. For instance, if you've inherited a genetic mutation that predisposes you to cancer, that doesn't mean you're certain to get cancer. Instead, you may need one or more other gene mutations to cause cancer. A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to: 1  Allow rapid growth. 2  A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. 3  This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation. 4  Fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth.
In regards to tile installation costs, consumers can expect to pay an average of $25 per square foot, depending on the grade of material that is used. For a medium-sized shower, the price can cost about $2,000. Tile installation materials include:
Over half of the supply of palladium and its congener platinum goes into catalytic converters, which convert up to 90% of harmful gases from auto exhaust (hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide) into less-harmful substances (nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor). Palladium is a soft silver-white metal that resembles platinum. It is the least dense and has the lowest melting point of the platinum group metals. It is soft and ductile when annealed and greatly increases its strength and hardness when it is cold-worked.

The Birds filming location: the Schoolhouse: Bodega Lane, Bodega, Northern California. Alfred Hitchcock ’s film of the Daphne du Maurier short story (originally set in Cornwall, England) uses lots of process (special effects) shots but, as usual, the director plays fair with the geography. The Birds filming location: the restaurant: Tides Wharf and Restaurant, Bodega Bay, Northern California. The Tides Wharf & Restaurant, in which the assorted locals shelter from the bird attacks, has expanded into an unrecognisable hotel complex since the film was made. The big surprise is that there is no town.
A boil, also known as a skin abscess or furuncle, is a painful, pus-filled lump that develops on the surface of the skin. Boils can be as small as a pea or as large as a golf ball and can develop on any part of the body. They are usually caused by the infection of a hair follicle or oil gland in the skin.

1 Higher-end tile such as granite or marble is going to cost more than a standard ceramic tile. 2  On average, plan on spending anywhere from $2,500 to as much as $5,000 or more for a standard 3′ x 5′ shower. 3  Showers can widely vary in size, but most of the time the cost will be within this price range.
A normal amount of albumin in your urine is less that 20 mg a day. A normal total protein amount in your urine is less that 150 mg a day. If your test shows high levels of urine albumin, or a rise in urine albumin, it could mean you have kidney damage or disease.
The attention devoted to the tales of the Decameron among English poets of the Romantic period is indicative of a certain fundamental yet complex relationship between the aspirations and the themes of Boccaccio's text and those of the poetry of that revolutionary generation of writers. (It is interesting to note that Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poem . The Garden of Boccaccio , a piece specifically about the spirit of Boccaccio and the Decameron, presents a perfect example of the mesh of naturalism and medievalism.
Examples of shield volcanoes are Kilauea and Mauna Loa (and their Hawaiian friends), Fernandina (and its Galapagos galápagos), Friends, Karthala Erta, Ale, Tolbachik, masaya and many. Others here are 4 of the volcanoes that comprise the big island Of'hawai. i Shield Volcanoes. Shield volcanoes are the largest volcanoes on Earth that actually look like volcanoes (i.e. not counting flood basalt flows). The Hawaiian shield volcanoes are the most famous examples. Shield volcanoes are almost exclusively basalt, a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted.

Esophagus. The esophagus is a collapsible muscular tube that serves as a passageway between the pharynx and stomach. As it descends, it is posterior to the trachea and anterior to the vertebral column. It passes through an opening in the diaphragm, called the esophageal hiatus, and then empties into the stomach. 
Urinalysis, also called a routine urine test, is used to check for abnormalities in the urine.Urine is liquid waste, which is made by the kidneys and stored in the bladder until it is eliminated by the body through urination. A number of diseases and conditions can result in abnormalities in the urine. These abnormalities often may be detected through physical, chemical, and microscopic examination. Urinalysis may be performed as part of a regular physical examination to screen for early signs of disease.

The history of RFID has shown a steady development in RFID technology. Having its routes in the earliest days of electrical science and then radio, RFID history has come out of developments such as radar and IFF.
Acidosis occurs when your kidneys and lungs can’t keep your body’s pH in balance. There are two types of acidosis--metabolic and respiratory. Metabolic acidosis occurs when your kidneys can’t get rid of acid buildup or when your body gets rid of too much base. Bases neutralize acids, and vice versa. Respiratory acidosis occurs when your lungs do not properly eliminate the carbon dioxide (CO2). 1 This base helps to keep the blood neutral. 2  Both diarrhea and vomiting can cause this type of acidosis. 3  Lactic acidosis occurs when there is too much lactic acid in your body. 4  Many things can cause a buildup of lactic acid.
The Cat in the Hat would change all that. Seuss wrote the book to teach children how to read, and its success allowed him to write full-time for children. Indeed, the Cat made Dr. Seuss a household name. With the publication of The Cat in the Hat in the spring of 1957 and of How the Grinch Stole Christmas! later that year, Dr. Seuss became an icon of American children's literature. He was born Theodor Seuss Geisel in Springfield, Massachusetts, on March 2, 1904.
1 Place in a saucepan covered with salted water to taste (with at least 1 tsp of vinegar). 2  Boil until tender [usually, 30-45 minutes, depending on the size of the beets]. 3  Boiling can take up to 60 minutes for larger beets. 4  Drain and run cold water over beets.
1 Both diarrhea and vomiting can cause this type of acidosis. 2  Lactic acidosis occurs when there is too much lactic acid in your body. 3  Many things can cause a buildup of lactic acid. 4  These include chronic alcohol use, heart failure, cancer, seizures, liver failure, prolonged lack of oxygen, and low blood sugar. 1 This base helps to keep the blood neutral. 2  Both diarrhea and vomiting can cause this type of acidosis. 3  Lactic acidosis occurs when there is too much lactic acid in your body. 4

JaimieCS said: Silverbeet is almost the same as spinach in terms of nutrients, and it's super easy to grow, it's practically a weed! it also keeps fresher for longer and freezes a bit better too. Not as nice in salads though.
Cancer is caused by changes (mutations) to the DNA within cells. The DNA inside a cell is packaged into a large number of individual genes, each of which contains a set of instructions telling the cell what functions to perform, as well as how to grow and divide. Errors in the instructions can cause the cell to stop its normal function and may allow a cell to become cancerous. A gene mutation can instruct a healthy cell to: 1  Allow rapid growth. 2  A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. 3  This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation. 4  Fail to stop uncontrolled cell growth.
That's an impact of around 170mph!   The stitching on a baseball is done in a precise and consistent manner in order to allow for a consistent movement of a pitched ball. The spin (or lack there of) on a baseball is what makes the ball 'fly' like it does. As the ball cuts through the air, the stitches on the ball create aerodynamic forces of varying amounts on different sides of the ball. This allows for specialized pitches such as the curve, slider, knuckle
It is based upon individual selfishness and not communal goals. To conclude, it is evident that global capitalism has developed a panetary consumer culture and that that culture both excludes and exploits. However, consumer culture is not 'based' upon exploitation and exclusion. Instead, it is based upon progress and the continual rise of living standards. It is an unfortunate consequence that this occurs in an exploitative and exclusive way, but it is not an intended goal.
Two forms of vitamin A are available in the human diet: preformed vitamin A (retinol and its esterified form, retinyl ester) and provitamin A carotenoids [ 1-5 ]. Preformed vitamin A is found in foods from animal sources, including dairy products, fish, and meat (especially liver). By far the most important provitamin A carotenoid is beta-carotene; other provitamin A carotenoids are alpha-carotene and beta-cryptoxanthin. A portion of the vitamin A in some supplements is in the form of beta-carotene and the remainder is preformed vitamin A; others contain only preformed vitamin A or only beta-carotene. Supplement labels usually indicate the percentage of each form of the vitamin.
RECOMMENDED LESSONS: Chemical energy. Chemical Energy is energy stored in the bonds of chemical compounds (atoms and molecules). It is released in a chemical reaction, often producing heat as a by product (exothermic reaction) . Batteries, biomass, petroleum, natural gas, and coal are examples of stored chemical energy. As it burns in the fireplace, chemical energy is released and converted to thermal energy (heat) and light energy. Notice that the wood now turns into ashes (a new substance). Food is also a good example
This award superseded the Volunteer Officer's Decoration when the Territorial Force was formed on 1 April 1908, following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, (7 Edw.7, c.9) which was a large reorganisation of the old Volunteer Army and the remaining units of militia and Yeomanry. For members of the Honourable Artillery Company the ribbon differed, being a half blue, half scarlet ribbon, with yellow edges. This distinction was bestowed by King Edward VII for the Volunteer Long Service And Good Conduct Medal and the honour extended to the same medals under the Territorial designations.

Adenosine 5'-triphosphate, or ATP, is the most abundant energy carrier molecule in cells. This molecule is made of a nitrogen base (adenine), a ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups. The word adenosine refers to the adenine plus the ribose sugar. 
Cause. Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR) is a highly contagious, infectious respiratory disease that is caused by Bovine Herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1). It can affect young and older cattle. In addition to causing respiratory disease, this virus can cause conjunctivitis, abortions, encephalitis, and generalised systemic infections. IBR is characterised by acute inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. After the first infection, the virus is never fully removed. It stays behind in nerve cells in the brain as a life-long latent (hidden) infection.

The interquartile range is a value that is the difference between the upper quartile value and the lower quartile value. Coach Taylor can use the interquartile range to summarize the overall accuracy of his players. To find the quartiles of this data set use the following steps: 1  Order the data from least to greatest. To find the interquartile range, simply take the upper quartile and subtract the lower quartile: 7.5 - 2.5 = 5. The interquartile range for this data set is 5. That means that the majority of the group can make about five out of ten free throw shots.
Apothem. The apothem of a regular polygon is a segment drawn the center of the polygon (that is, the center of the circle which circumscribes the polygon) to one side, such that it is perpendicular to the side. If a regular polygon has an area of A square units, a perimeter of P units, an apothem of a units, then the area is one-half the product of the perimeter and the apothem. Be careful with this formula, though: for a given apothem, there is only ONE POSSIBLE value of P.

Preparation. 1  To poach a pasteurized egg, first fill a deep saucepan or large saute sauté pan about-half full of water and set over high. 2  Heat add some, salt for, flavor and white vinegar or lemon – juice this helps to keep the white of the egg from. 3  Spreading, next crack a pasteurized egg into a small custard.  cup 1 Use a spoon to gently gather the white around the yolk, then cook for 3 minutes. 2  To test for doneness, lift the egg from the water using a slotted spoon and gently jiggle the spoon to make sure the white is solid. 3  Carefully return the egg to the poaching water if you prefer a less runny yolk.
A pōwhiri may not be performed for every group of manuhiri (visitors); a mihi whakatau (informal greeting to visitors) may be used instead. Pōwhiri is often used for special visitors or for tūpāpaku (the body of the deceased) for a tangihanga (funeral). The first warrior represents the realm of Tumatauenga, the Atua (God) of War. The third Warrior represents Rongo the Atua of Peace (Rangimarie). It is the final warrior who offers the rautapu, a signal that the manuhiri (guests) may enter the Marae-atea.
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends cooking ground beef, pork and lamb patties or mixtures such as meat loaf to 160°F. Whole pork cuts such as chops and roasts should be cooked to 145°F (medium), or 170°F (well done). 1 All meat should be thawed before cooking in the microwave (even it is thawed in the microwave) to produce a high quality product. 2  For safety reasons, do not cook poultry from the frozen state. 3  Arrange meat uniformly in the cookware. 4  Boneless meat cooks most evenly so debone large pieces of meat.

by Mark Cartwright. Greek tragedy was a popular and influential form of drama performed in theatres across ancient Greece from the late 6th century BCE. The most famous playwrights of the genre were Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides and many of their works were still performed centuries after their initial premiere. Greek tragedy led to Greek comedy and, together, these genres formed the foundation upon which all modern theatre is based. In the Roman world, tragedy plays were translated and imitated in Latin, and the genre gave rise to a new art form from the 1st century BCE, pantomime, which drew inspiration from the presentation and subject matter of Greek tragedy.
Kuchen. Kuchen was designated the official state dessert of South Dakota in 2000. Kuchen is the German word for cake and is used to describe a variety of different types of sweet desserts and pastries.

Laser tape measures are alternatives to traditional metal tape measures; they're used to calculate lengths, widths and heights of up to about 650 feet (198 meters). To use a laser tape measure, you place the device on one end of what you want to measure, and then aim the laser beam so that it hits an object at the other end. If there's no wall, pole or anything like that, you can put a target at the spot you want to measure up to
It makes up the part of the throat situated immediately posterior to the nasal cavity, posterior to the mouth and superior to the esophagus and larynx. The human pharynx is conventionally divided into three sections: the nasopharynx, the oropharynx and the laryngopharynx. It is also important in vocalization. The upper portion of the pharynx, the nasopharynx, extends from the base of the skull to the upper surface of the soft palate. It includes the space between the internal nares and the soft palate and lies above the oral cavity.
Sydney is the capital city of the Australian state of New South Wales, and Australia's largest city. A week in Sydney will help you see many of the sights of Sydney and its surrounds, and understand the city and its culture. If you're up for exploring the area by bike (one of the best ways to do so as much of it is parkland), take the train to Concord West station on the Northern Line (red line on the Sydney Trains map-about 20-25 minutes from the city on a direct train).
In fiscal 2014, Walgreens opened a total of 184 new locations and acquired 84 locations, for a net decrease of 273 after relocations and closings. How big are your stores? The average size for a typical Walgreens is about 14,500 square feet and the sales floor averages about 11,000 square feet. How do we select locations for new stores? There are several factors that Walgreens takes into account, such as major intersections, traffic patterns, demographics and locations near hospitals.

It is a goods movement that is used to post goods received from external vendors or from in-plant production. All goods receipts result in an increase of stock in
A bouillon cube is dehydrated stock formed into a small cube or dried granules. When you want to use one, you just add boiling water. There are a range of different flavors available. I find the most useful ones are chicken, vegetable, beef and fish. You can get others including lamb, shrimp, duck and tomato. Store bought stock/broth and bouillon cubes can be VERY salty. Many people cook rick with stock instead of water. You may want to cut back on the salt in your recipe if you are substituting the water for stock. Reviewers often say the best broth/stock on the market is the Swanson brand name, which comes in liquid form.

When the hair follicle becomes infected, the skin around it also becomes inflamed. The furuncle looks like a red, raised bump on your skin, but can later rupture and weep fluid. Furuncles are most commonly found on the face and neck. You might also develop a boil on your thigh or buttocks. Symptoms of a Furuncle. A furuncle may begin as a benign-looking bump on your skin, similar to a pimple. As the infection worsens, however, the boil can become painful and hard. Bacteria and dead skin cells may then build up underneath the skin, forming pu
ATP or adenosine triphosphate stores and releases energy by adding or breaking off one of the phosphate molecules on its tail. When a phosphate molecule breaks off of ATP it r … eleases energy. Likewise, if an ADP (a ATP with one lose phosphate group than ATP) gains a phosphate group, energy is stored. The energy is located in the bonds between the atoms in the form of potential energy.

The term hummingbird moth is a general term applied to many medium to large moths in the Sphingidae family and Hemaris genus of moths. There are more than 1,200 species of these moths worldwide, and roughly 125 of them can be seen regularly in North America. 1 Flocks: Hummingbirds are more aggressive than moths, and while some flocks may form at feeding areas, it is more common to see hummingbirds alone. 2  Hummingbird moths, however, are more likely to travel together and show no aggression toward other moths.
Posted: Jul-12 10:24 AM (1 of 31). Our local pools allow kids to swim alone at 8 years old. They are staffed with lifeguards but even so, my newest Parent's magazine stated that accidental drowning deaths were the second most common way for children ages 5-14 to lose their life. The particular story they featured had a child age 4, who had completed swimming lessons and was fearless of the water. Our local pool has the rule that kids 7 and under need to be with an adult in the water. 8-11 an adult needs to be at the pool with them but can sit in on the deck of the pool. After 11 if they can pass a swim test then they're good to go.
Self-awareness test of the baby. Performing the self-awareness test of the baby is quite simple. If you put a red dot on the baby’s forehead and show him the mirror, notice what he does. If they rub the dot, they are aware, else not. Higher ratio of birth mark. The ratio of birth mark among babies is very high i.e. one baby born out of every 3 babies have a birth mark present on their body. Baby girls have more probability of birth marks than baby boys.
Often, physiologic jaundice -- the type seen in most newborns -- does not require aggressive treatment. It will typically disappear in a few days with frequent feedings and exposure to indirect sunlight at home. Doctors may test the baby 's bilirubin levels during that time to make sure it has not gotten worse.
Introduction. You can solve any quadratic equation by completing the square—rewriting part of the equation as a perfect square trinomial. If you complete the square on the generic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 and then solve for x, you find that. 
Fossil fuels also generate a lot of money and are a good source of revenue to many countries. They also help related industries provide jobs for people across the globe which is good for the overall economy. Fossil fuels are used for both residential and commercial purposes. The three main fossil fuels are natural gas, oil, and coal. Fossil fuels are low in cost and are very important resources for our economy. Fossil fuels are used to generate electricity used as fuels for transportation.
Kitchen Fact: Cooked food stored in the refrigerator should be eaten in 3 to 4 days. After food is cooked, it should sit out at room temperature no more than two hours before being refrigerated to slow down bacteria growth. But once stored in the fridge, leftovers should be eaten up within three to four days because bacteria can still grow even at refrigerator temperatures. To help you remember how long something has been in the fridge, we recommend labeling it with the date it was cooked to help you keep track!
The filing fee is $130 for a small entity and drawings typically cost $100 to $125 per page, so a high quality provisional patent application for a mechanical or electrical device can typically be prepared and filed for $2,500 to $3,000. By way of example, you could probably find an attorney to write a patent for a business method or computer software for quite cheap, but a cheap computer related patent would not be nearly as strong as a patent application costing $20,000 or more. The devil is always in the details.
Bacterial Conjunctivitis. Bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by infection of the eye with certain bacteria. Bacterial conjunctivitis. 1  Usually begins in one eye and may sometimes progress to the second eye. 2  Is a leading cause of children being absent from day care or school (Patel, 2007). Viral conjunctivitis. 1  Can be caused by a number of different viruses, many of which may be associated with an upper respiratory tract infection, cold, or sore throat. 2  Usually begins in one eye and may progress to the second eye within days. 3  Spreads easily and rapidly between people and can result in epidemics.
Conduction occurs when energy is transferred through an object due to the movement of particle due to contact. The energy that is transferred is in the form of heat or electricity, so the two types of conduction that we discussed are conduction of heat and conduction of electricity. Conduction is the transfer of energy in the form of heat or electricity from one atom to another within an object by direct contact. Conduction occurs in solids, liquids, and gases.
Not all pain in the wrist or hand is caused by carpal tunnel syndrome. There are many other conditions with similar symptoms, such as: 1  An injury to the muscles, ligaments, tendons, or bones. 2  Nerve problems in the fingers, elbow, or neck. 3  Arthritis in the thumb joint or wrist.
Thermal conduction is the transfer of internal energy by microscopic diffusion and collisions of particles or quasi-particles within a body or between contiguous bodies. The microscopically diffusing and colliding objects include molecules, atoms, electrons, and phonons. In conduction, the heat flow is within and through the body itself. In contrast, in heat transfer by thermal radiation, the transfer is often between bodies, which may be separated spatially.
The stories in The Decameron range from stories about bawdy intrigues to stories about bourgeois merchants to stories about the pains and tragedies of love to stories of religious capers with monks with farce, comedy, and tragedy all included. Boccaccio's 100 stories are highly structured and may be metaphorically viewed as his gift of order on a disordered world. In these structured stories, Boccaccio celebrates two thematic ideas. The first theme is, as he writes in his dedication, is womanhood and love. The second theme is the intelligence of humankind.

Fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, are energy sources because they contain chemical potential energy. Page 2 of 2. Figure 1. An object can have potential energy that causes a change to occur. Figure 2. A spring has elastic potential energy when it is compressed or stretched. Figure 3. The atoms in molecules are held together by chemical bonds that store chemical potential energy. 
Hepatitis C. You get this type if you have contact with contaminated blood or needles used to inject illegal drugs or draw tattoos. Sometimes you don't get any symptoms, or just mild ones. But in some cases hepatitis C leads to cirrhosis, a risky scarring of your liver. If your doctor tells you that you've got hepatitis, you'll need to find out which type he's talking about. There are five kinds, and each has different causes. They share one thing in common: Hepatitis infects your liver and causes it to get inflamed.

1 Remove the egg: Use a slotted spoon to remove the egg from the water. 2  Pat the egg dry: This is optional as well, but I like to pat the egg dry lightly with a paper towel. 3  Season and eat! 4  Place the poached egg on a salad, piece of toast, or a plate and season to taste with salt and pepper. Let me show you how I poach an egg; there's really nothing to it. Pin it. The big difference between an easy poached egg and a slightly more difficult one is your tolerance for imperfection. I admit it's tough to get the perfectly round, satiny smooth poached eggs you see adorning restaurant dishes.

The British Aerospace Sea Harrier is a naval V/STOL jet fighter, reconnaissance and attack aircraft, a development of the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. The first version entered service with the Royal Navy 's Fleet Air Arm in April 1980 as the Sea Harrier FRS.1, and was informally known as the Shar. The Harrier Jump Jet, capable of taking off vertically, can only do so at less than its maximum loaded weight. In most cases, a short take off is performed, using forward speed to achieve aerodynamic lift, which uses fuel more economically than a vertical take off.

Beta-carotene is a precursor for vitamin A. The body needs to convert it to retinol or vitamin A for use. Beta-carotene is found naturally in mostly orange and dark green plant foods, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, mangos, and kale. Vitamin A is a family of fat-soluble compounds that play an important role in vision, bone growth, reproduction, cell division, and cell differentiation. Vitamin A is important for healthy bones. However, too much vitamin A has been linked to bone loss and an increase in the risk of hip fracture.
Electron Transport and Oxidative Phosphorylation. In the final stage of respiration, ATP is formed through a series of electron transfer reactions within the cytoplasmic membrane that drive the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP. Bacteria use various flavins, cytochrome, and non-heme iron components as well as multiple cytochrome oxidases for this process. 
The oropharynx extends from the back of the mouth and carries ingested food and drinks from the mouth into the esophagus. The laryngopharynx lies just behind the larynx (voice box) and is the lowermost part of the pharynx. It serves as a common passage for both food (into the esophagus) and air (into the larynx). It starts from the back of the mouth and nose and extends down into the esophagus. It runs from the base of the skull to the inferior border of the C6 vertebra, which is posterior to the pharynx, and the cricoid cartilage, which lies anterior to
What does the surgery cost? Spay/neuter costs vary tremendously in different areas of the country. The low end of the range can be as inexpensive as $50-75 (often in spay/neuter clinics), while vets in major metropolitan areas, where rents and labor costs are very high, often charge several hundred dollars. See our veterinary listings.
If you have the money and you will definitely use the site at least several times each week, then 'yes'. If you would likely spend $120 in the year on more video games or puzzle books and such, then it's definitely worth it to give Lumosity a try and skip the other stuff for a year. But, in my opinion, Lumosity is really only good for one year. After that, it loses its worth (and that worth is definitely already subjective; see below). And, if you don't really have the money, then don't do it. There are a lot of other things that you could spend $120 on.
In cases where pre-hepatic jaundice has been caused by an infection, such as malaria, medication to treat the underlying infection is usually recommended. For genetic blood disorders, such as sickle cell anaemia or thalassaemia, blood transfusions may be required to replace the red blood cells.

It is most commonly caused by infection by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, resulting in a painful swollen area on the skin caused by an accumulation of pus and dead tissue. Signs and symptoms [edit]. Boils are bumpy, red, pus-filled lumps around a hair follicle that are tender, warm, and very painful. They range from pea-sized to golf ball-sized. A yellow or white point at the center of the lump can be seen when the boil is ready to drain or discharge pus.
And it's why the number of drive-thru windows at fast-food stands has doubled in five years. (The industry cooks better than it spells: It's drive-through in English class, but it's drive-thru at every major chain.). In 1975, McDonald's didn't have a single drive-thru. Today, more than 90% of its 13,000 U.S. restaurants do. Industrywide, 80% of fast food's growth over the past five years has been at the drive-thru. Most drive-thru customers are just stopping to fill their guts, says Bob Sandelman, a fast-food consultant. The industry's bread and butter  folks who buy fast food 25 to 30 times monthly  are the biggest drive-thru fans, he says.

Tracking Ovulation: A woman’s monthly cycle is measured from the first day of her menstrual period until the first day of her next period. On average, a woman’s cycle normally is between 28-32 days, but some women may have much shorter or much longer cycles. Ovulation can be calculated by starting with the first day of the last menstrual period (LMP) or by calculating 12-16 days from the next expected period. The second half of the cycle is called the luteal phase and is from the day of ovulation until the next period begins. The luteal phase has a more precise timeline and usually is only 12-16 days from the day of ovulation. This ultimately means that the day of ovulation will determine how long your cycle is

According to USDA, ribs are done when they are 145°F internal temp, but they may still be tough. If you take them up to 180°F, drop the oven temp to about 180°F and hold them at this temp for about 30 minutes, the collagens and fats melt some more at this temp and make the meat more tender and juicy. On most cookers, when the oven temp is 225°F at sea level, it takes about three to four hours to cook a slab of baby backs and about five to six hours to cook a slab of St. Louis cut ribs or spares. They are slightly undercooked at that stage.
Storing food is a delicate matter -- in the fridge, food might get moist and moldy, and in the freezer it could lose all its moisture or get freezer burn.

Bonding with Chemical Potential Energy. Chemical potential energy is that which is stored within the bonds of atoms and molecules of a substance. The bonds have stored chemical potential energy which is released when they are broken and the substance undergoes a chemical reaction. An example of this principle is in a combustion reaction within a car's engine. The gasoline reacts with oxygen when ignited by a spark in the engine. Chemical potential energy that once was stored is then released and the car is set in motion.

Conclusions: In adult body CT, dose to an organ fully encompassed by the primary radiation beam can be estimated from CTDI vol using a protocol-independent conversion coefficient. However, fully encompassed organs only account for 50% ± 19% of k factor and 46% ± 24% of q factor. Dose received by partially encompassed organs is also substantial. To estimate effective dose and risk index from DLP, it is necessary to use conversion coefficients specific to the anatomical region examined.

Western Blotting. Western blot analysis can detect one protein in a mixture of any number of proteins while giving you information about the size of the protein. It does not matter whether the protein has been synthesized in vivo or in vitro. You will use this antibody as a probe to detect the protein of interest. Western blotting tells you how much protein has accumulated in cells. If you are interested in the rate of synthesis of a protein, Radio-Immune Precipitation (RIP) may be the best assay for you.

laryngocele. [ləring′gōsēl′]. an abnormal air-containing cavity connected to the laryngeal ventricle. It is caused by a protrusion of the mucous membrane of the ventricle and may displace and enlarge the false vocal cord, resulting in hoarseness and airway obstruction. Because a laryngocele is also a potential reservoir of infection, it is usually excised. Also called laryngeal pouch, saccule of larynx.
Report Abuse. We have time zones so that everyone on the planet does most things at the same time that a person does in another part of the world such as sleeping for example. The majority of people sleep at night. The reason there are different time zones and an International dateline is because there are different times. I suppose we could all go on GMT but that would mean that when it is 12:00 GMT it would be the middle of the night in Tokyo and early morning in New York.

Dioneo narrates what is by far the most obscene and bawdy tale in the Decameron. Alibech, a naive young woman, wanders into the desert in an attempt to become closer to God. She happens upon the monk Rustico, and he deflowers her under the pretense of teaching her how to better please God. This tale is originally found in Hitopadesha, a Sanskrit collection of tales. Boccaccio, though, may have directly taken the tale from The Seven Wise Masters, which, although oriental in origin, was widely circulating in Latin at the time the Decameron was written.
The Decameron (From the Greek: δέκα - ten & μέρα - day) (Italian: Decameron [deˈkaːmeron] or Decamerone [dekameˈroːne]), subtitled Prince Galehaut (Old Italian: Prencipe Galeotto [ˌprentʃipe ɡaleˈɔtto]), is a collection of novellas by the 14th-century Italian author Giovanni Boccaccio (1313–1375). Boccaccio probably conceived the Decameron after the epidemic of 1348, and completed it by 1353. The various tales of love in The Decameron range from the erotic to the tragic. Tales of wit, practical jokes, and life lessons contribute to the mosaic. In addition to its literary value and widespread influence (for example on Chaucer 's The Canterbury Tales), it provides a document of life at the time

On Earth, gold is found in ores in rock formed from the Precambrian time onward. It most often occurs as a native metal, typically in a metal solid solution with silver (i.e. as a gold silver alloy). Such alloys usually have a silver content of 8–10%. The oxidation state of gold in its compounds ranges from −1 to +5, but Au(I) and Au(III) dominate its chemistry. Au(I), referred to as the aurous ion, is the most common oxidation state with soft ligands such as thioethers, thiolates, and tertiary phosphines. Au(I) compounds are typically linear.

Dr. T. Balasubramanian M.S. D.L.O. History: This benign tumor was first described by Virchow in 1863. He defined it as an anomalous air sac communicating with the laryngeal ventricle. He initially used the term laryngocele ventricularis to describe this condition. Laryngoceles are intimately associated with laryngeal saccule, which is infact an appendix of the laryngeal ventricle. If the accumulated fluid is mucoid in nature the term laryngomucocele is used. If it is filled with pus then laryngopyocele is used to describe the mass. Pathophysiology: Factors that cause an increase in intra laryngeal pressure like coughing, straining, blowing wind instruments may cause laryngocele.

Western blot using an antibody that recognizes proteins modified with lipoic acid. The western blot (sometimes called the protein immunoblot) is a widely used analytical technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample of tissue homogenate or extract. It uses gel electrophoresis to separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide. The name western blot was given to the technique by W. Neal Burnette and is a play on the name Southern blot, a technique for DNA detection developed earlier by Edwin Southern.

Fossil fuels are sources of energy that have developed within the earth over millions of years. Because fossil fuels-oil, natural gas, and coal-take so long to form, they are considered nonrenewable. Let's review. Fossil fuels are sources of energy that formed from the accumulated remains of living organisms that were buried millions of years ago. Pressure, heat and time allow the organic matter to transform into one of the three major types of fossil fuels, which are coal, oil and natural gas.
Roughly 96 percent of the mass of the human body is made up of just four elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen and nitrogen, with a lot of that in the form of water. The remaining 4 percent is a sparse sampling of the periodic table of elements. Oxygen (65%) and hydrogen (10%) are predominantly found in water, which makes up about 60 percent of the body by weight. It's practically impossible to imagine life without water.
The Discriminant. In the quadratic formula, the expression under the square root sign, b 2 – 4 ac, is called the discriminant. The sign of the discriminant can be used to find the number of solutions of the corresponding quadratic equation, ax 2 + bx + c = 0. If the discriminant b 2 – 4 ac is negative, then there are no real solutions of the equation. If the discriminant is positive, then the ± symbol means you get two answers. The solutions of this equation correspond to the x-intercepts of the parabola. y = ax 2 + bx + c. So, you can also use the discriminant to find the number of x-intercepts of a parabola.

Since half the scores in a distribution lie between Q3 and Q1, the semi-interquartile range is 1/2 the distance needed to cover 1/2 the scores. In a symmetric distribution, an interval stretching from one semi-interquartile range below the median to one semi-interquartile above the median will contain 1/2 of the scores. Next section: Variance and Standard Deviation. The semi-interquartile range is a measure of spread or dispersion. It is computed as one half the difference between the 75th percentile [often called (Q3)] and the 25th percentile (Q1). The formula for semi-interquartile range is therefore: (Q3-Q1)/2

Advantages of Fossil Fuels. A major advantage of fossil fuels is their capacity to generate huge amounts of electricity in just a single location. Fossil fuels are very easy to find. When coal is used in power plants, they are very cost effective. Coal is also in abundant supply. Transporting oil and gas to the power stations can be made through the use of pipes making it an easy task. Disadvantages of Fossil Fuels Pollution is a major disadvantage of fossil fuels. This is because they give off carbon dioxide when burned thereby causing a greenhouse effect. This is also the main contributory factor to the global warming experienced by the earth today.

The concept is a departure from the traditional concept of the bottom line, which evaluates all efforts in terms of their short-term effect on profits. In traditional corporate cultures, social and environmental concerns have typically been considered to conflict with financial goals. The goal of sustainability requires a more extended timeline for return on investment (ROI) but once initial investments are made, they can actually lead to increased profitability. One example is free cooling for data centers, which takes advantage of naturally-occurring phenomena to control temperatures.

The plant: This plant was grown from seeds which called it perpetual spinach, which is a type of silver beet and is also known as Chard or even Swiss Chard. Spinach (as opposed to ‘perpetual spinach’) is a completely different plant and does taste different as well as having a much more velvety texture when cooked. Regardless though in recipes where the spinach is cooked you can often substitute silver beet/chard. There are some fantastic Chard varieties – I love the rainbow ones in particular as they look fantastic in the garden (unfortunately I ran out of seed and this year and only planted green stemmed plants).
Ovulation is the release of a single, mature egg from a follicle that developed in the ovary. It usually occurs regularly, around day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. Once released, the egg is capable of being fertilized for 12 to 48 hours before it begins to disintegrate. This is the most fertile period of your cycle: during ovulation your chances of conception are highest. The time of ovulation within the menstrual cycle is determined by the luteal phase, which is usually 12 to 16 days long. You can calculate the time of ovulation within your cycle by subtracting the length of your luteal phase from the length of your cycle. For example, if your cycle is 28 days long and your luteal phase is 12 days long, the ovulation will occur on day 16 of your cycle (28-12=16)
Length of Typical Master’s Degree Programs. The majority of master’s degrees awarded in 2010 were in just two fields – education and business.

Once these were factored in, the actual cost of the system was around $6,000 plus the cost of installation. The current federal tax credit is 30 percent of the cost of home solar panels. You will receive that back as a refund on your next year’s taxes. You also must factor in the cost of labor to determine the cost of residential solar panels. How much the installation of the system will cost depends on the size of the panels and your home. In some cases, installation can double the cost of the system. Call local contractors who are experienced with installing solar panels for an estimate

Some if not most Rastafarians choose not to use certain words in the English language as they have Babylonian and devil-like connotations, for example the word Hello is not used because it contains the word hell and lo referring to low.
The conifers, division Pinophyta, also known as division Coniferophyta or Coniferae, are one of 12 extant division-level taxa within the Kingdom Plantae (Viridiplantae) and 10 within the extant land plants. The conifers are an ancient group, with a fossil record extending back about 300 million years to the Paleozoic in the late Carboniferous period; even many of the modern genera are recognizable from fossils 60–120 million years old.

Carp is a common name for various species of freshwater fish of the family Cyprinidae, a very large group of fish native to Europe and Asia. Carp are also popular with spear and bow fisherman. They can grow to a length of 1.2 metres (3.9 ft) and the oldest recorded age of a wild fish is 38 years. The largest recorded carp, caught by British angler, Colin Smith, in 2013 at Etang La Saussaie Fishery, France, weighed 45.59 kilograms (100.5 lb).
Today, ancestral Pinatubo is exposed in relict walls of an old 3.5x4.5-km caldera, recognized by Delfin (1983, 1984) and named here the Tayawan caldera (fig. 3). Prominent points on the relict rim of that caldera include Mount Donald Macdonald (southeast caldera rim) and Mount Tayawan (north-northeast caldera rim). Radiocarbon ages suggest that eruptions from the modern Pinatubo have been clustered in at least six and possibly as many as a dozen eruptive periods. Each eruptive period is short in relation to intervening repose periods (table 1, fig. 5). Each of these six eruptive periods of modern Mount Pinatubo is described below.

Your heart is located under your ribcage in the center of your chest between your right and left lungs. Its muscular walls beat, or contract, pumping blood to all parts of your body. The size of your heart can vary depending on your age, size, and the condition of your heart. Oxygen-rich blood from your lungs passes through the pulmonary veins (shown in red to the right of the left atrium in figure B above). The blood enters the left atrium and is pumped into the left ventricle. From the left ventricle, the oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the rest of your body through the aorta.
Bulimia Nervosa Overview. Bulimia nervosa (bulimia) is characterized by repeatedly eating abnormally large amounts of food in a short period of time and then trying to compensate for the binge by purging (i.e., engaging in self-induced vomiting, using laxatives or diuretics), exercising excessively, or fasting. The average age of onset for bulimia is 18 years, but it occurs in children as young as 9 and adults into their mid-40s and older. Most bulimics go through a period of prolonged dieting or restricted eating before the cyclic binging-purging episodes begin.

If consumer capitalism is indeed replaced by a new economic structure, many capitalist bricks may still be needed for any new construction. Whether we choose to attempt new building or just apply a little patching here or there is up to us. What label we pin on any newly emerging economic system is not as important as its ingredients. The problem with our present consumer capitalism is not the name. Critics do not desire an anti-consumer capitalism, just one that does not overemphasize consumption.

Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) is a virus of the family Herpesviridae and the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae, known to cause several diseases worldwide in cattle, including rhinotracheitis, vaginitis, balanoposthitis, abortion, conjunctivitis, and enteritis. Although these symptoms are mainly non-life-threatening it is an economically important disease as infection may cause a drop in production and affect trade restrictions. Like other herpesviruses, BoHV-1 causes a lifelong latent infection and sporadic shedding of the virus.
People with cirrhosis have an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer. Hepatitis B and C, alcoholism, hemochromatosis, and primary biliary cirrhosis -- all causes of cirrhosis -- are some of the major risk factors for liver cancer. Cirrhosis due to hepatitis C is the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma in the United States. Alcoholic cirrhosis is the primary type of cirrhosis in the U.S. It develops in 10 - 20% of heavy drinkers, usually after 10 - 15 years of heavy alcohol consumption. People who drink heavily and who also have hepatitis C are at particular risk of developing cirrhosis.
Basalt and granite actually have quite a bit in common. Both are igneous rocks, which means that they cooled from a magma (the earth gets very hot just below the surface, and there is lots of liquid rock available). Both are made up of minerals from the silicate group, so both have large amounts of silicon and oxygen. Granite is the ultimate silicate rock. As discussed elsewhere in greater detail, on average oxygen and silicon account for 75% of the earth's crust. The remaining 25% is split among several other elements, with aluminum and potassium contributing the most to the formation of the continental granitic rocks.

In saying Yes to God, as Mary did, we are able to discover the path to conversion, to holiness, to authentic spirituality. Our call to embrace the Fiat and to make it our own is not a formula for easy spiritual growth, nor is it the first in a series of steps that lead to solving the problems of life. When we embrace Mary's Prayer and make it our own, we allow the Love that Mary bore in her body to be incarnated in and through us, too. Each of us can say Yes to God. Each of us can respond with our entire being, with a Fiat of surrendered love.

1 A homoplasy is a shared trait found among different taxa but inferred to have been independently derived and not to have occurred in their common ancestor (i.e., a trait considered to be the same emerged in different taxa independently of each other). 2  An example of this is homeothermy in birds and mammals. Simplicity is often secondarily derived. For example, the absence of mitochondria in the anaerobic protist Entamoeba histolytica is a result of their secondary loss, and when considered in the context of eukaryotes as a whole, is a derived trait.

Palladium Jewelry. Palladium is the newest precious metal. A platinum group metal, palladium is rare, lustrous, and naturally white. Palladium has the purity and white tone of platinum but is less dense, making it more affordable. From the same metal family as platinum, palladium is a naturally bright white metal. However, palladium is lighter and less dense than platinum, which also means that it's lighter on your wallet. And just like platinum, palladium jewelry is 95% pure, which means you get more precious metal in your jewelry: White gold is only 58.5% pure. And while white gold needs rhodium plating to keep it shiny, palladium jewelry does not. In fact, palladium is often used in white gold alloys.

The Enquirer found some pools allow children as young as 8 to be at the pool alone. Others used height as part of the equation. In Dayton, at city-owned pools, children 8 and younger must have a parent or guardian in the water at all times. At YMCAs, children must pass a swim test to go in the deep end of the pool. Farhad Madani, who owns Austin, Texas-based consulting company Aquatic Safety Experts, said there is no real appropriate age for a child to be left alone at a pool because every child is different. A person 16 and older can watch one child younger than 12 and a person 18 and older can watch up to 10 children who are younger than 12.
